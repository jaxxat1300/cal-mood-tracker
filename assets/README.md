# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image assets:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1242x2436px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon foreground (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using tools like:
- Expo's asset generator
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma

The app will work without these assets, but they're recommended for a polished production app.
