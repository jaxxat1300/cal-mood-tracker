# Fix 404 Error on GitHub Pages

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (Required)

The 404 error is likely because GitHub Pages isn't enabled yet. Do this:

1. Go to: https://github.com/jaxxat1300/cal-mood-tracker/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

### 2. Wait for Deployment

After enabling:
- Go to the **Actions** tab: https://github.com/jaxxat1300/cal-mood-tracker/actions
- Wait for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
- Make sure it shows ✅ (green checkmark), not ❌ (red X)

### 3. Access Your Site

Once deployment completes, your site will be available at:
```
https://jaxxat1300.github.io/cal-mood-tracker/
```

**Note**: It may take a few minutes after the workflow completes for the site to be accessible.

## If Still Getting 404

### Check Workflow Status
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Check if the "build" job completed successfully
4. Check if the "deploy" job completed successfully

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow failed**: Check the error logs in the Actions tab
2. **Pages not enabled**: Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. **Wrong branch**: The workflow runs on `main` branch pushes
4. **DNS propagation**: Wait 5-10 minutes after successful deployment

### Manual Trigger

If needed, you can manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Verify Everything is Working

After enabling GitHub Pages and the workflow completes:

1. ✅ Check Actions tab - workflow should be green
2. ✅ Check Settings → Pages - should show "Your site is live at..."
3. ✅ Visit https://jaxxat1300.github.io/cal-mood-tracker/

If all three are ✅, your site should be working!
